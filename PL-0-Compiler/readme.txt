Inside this folder will be the "hw4compiler.c" file which contains the program, a 
correct input and output labeled as "validin.txt" and "validout.txt" respectively,
as well as errorin and errorout .txt files for each of the errors that the compiler handles.

To start, compile the "hw4compiler.c" file by typing "gcc hw4compiler.c" into the
terminal. Then to run the compiled program type "./a.out input.txt" into the terminal,
input.txt being the input file you would like to run through the program.

The expected output will now be shown in the terminal.
If the input is valid, the Source Program will be formatted into machine language and output to the file "elf.txt".
